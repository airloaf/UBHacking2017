# Maze Solver for UB Hacking 2017

This python project will solve any maze with the following restrictions

* Maze walls are represented by black pixels
* Maze passageways are represented by white pixels
* Maze Entrance and exits must be on the top or bottom and must be the only white pixel there

Mazes were generated with the program called Daedalus found [here](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm)

When you run the program you can choose 4 different mazes of sizes 16 x 16, 128 x 128, 1024 x 1024, and 2048 x 2048
You can also choose the paint for the path, currently there is only rainbow and a gradient from red to green.
